A high-performance, console-based **Library Management System** built using Java.  
This application efficiently manages book inventories with synchronized collection handling, custom exception logic, and a robust CLI interface.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 📖 **Dynamic Inventory**  
  Add and manage books with author metadata.

- 🔄 **State Management**  
  Transition books between `Available` and `Issued` states.

- 🛡️ **Safe Iteration**  
  Uses `Iterator` to safely modify collections and avoid `ConcurrentModificationException`.

- ⚠️ **Error Handling**  
  Custom `BookNotFound` exception for precise debugging and user feedback.

- 🧾 **Transaction Logging**  
  Stores borrower name and issue date during checkout.

## 🎮 How to Use

Once the application starts, choose from the menu:

* 📚 **Available Books** → View all available books
* 📕 **Issued Books** → View borrowed books and details
* 📤 **Issue Book** → Assign a book to a borrower
* 📥 **Return Book** → Return a borrowed book
* ➕ **Add Book** → Add new books to the system
* ❌ **Exit** → Close the application

---

## 🧠 Code Logic Overview

The system uses two primary collections:

* **`books` List**
  Stores available books → `[Title, Author]`

* **`issuedbooks` List**
  Stores issued books → `[Title, Author, Borrower, Date]`

### 🔁 Return Flow

When a book is returned:

* Borrower data is removed
* Book is re-added to the main inventory
* Ensures memory efficiency and consistent structure
